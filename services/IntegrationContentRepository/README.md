The revolution in data synchronization â€” the Open Integration Hub enables simple data synchronization between any software applications and thus accelerates digitalisation

# Integration Content Repository (working title / Codename Bragi)

Bragi stores, retrieves and updates the integration flows of the Open Integration Hub.

All connected solutions to the Open Integration Hub and the work they are doing there are represented by an "integration flow". A data modification in one of the affected systems should propagate to all connected solutions / systems as defined in the corresponding integration flow.

The integration flows are defined by a single user of the Open Integration Hub or a member of an organization which uses the Open Integration Hub.

The flows are specified in JSON, therefore we store and retrieve them in JSON.

## Technical description
Bragi uses MongoDB for archiving the integration flows. We use Mongoose for object modeling. Mongoose is built on top of the official MongoDB Node.js driver.

For documenting the API Bragi uses the SwaggerUI. Controllers are build upon the middleware swagger-express-mw, which uses the popular web application framework ExpressJS.

As the webserver we use NGINX, which is also used as a reverse proxy.

## Installation

Bragi requires Docker and Docker Compose.

* Run docker-compose build and then docker-compose up

## REST-API documentation

Visit http://localhost:3001/docs to view the Swagger API-Documentation

## Current status
This is only a pre-release to show the functionality of a content repository.

It's obvious that there are some work to do, like:
* The definition of a flow is only a show case. It needs further specification
* There is no access control. Bragi has to be connected to the OIH-Heimdal-Service for user management.
* The API needs to be expanded, e.g. to manage flows of organizations
